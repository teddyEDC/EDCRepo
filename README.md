First open the Dalamud Settings menu in the game, accessible through typing `/xlsettings` in the chat or through the button at the bottom of the Plugin Installer.

Then follow the image:
1. Click the "Experimental" tab.
2. Paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnknownX7/DalamudPluginRepo/master/pluginmaster.json` into the empty box at the bottom of the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section (the last box will always have a + next to it).
3. Click the + button.
4. Click the ðŸ’¾ button.

Now these plugins will appear inside of the Plugin Installer, accessible through typing `/xlplugins` in the chat.
